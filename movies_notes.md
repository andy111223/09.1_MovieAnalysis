# Step-by-Step Directions for Point No. 1:
"Return the list of 10 highest-rated movies (by vote_average), whose vote_count is greater than the third quartile of the vote count distribution."

### Import Libraries: Start by importing the necessary libraries:

Import pandas to handle the data frames.
Import numpy for numerical calculations.
Load the Movie Data:

### Load the movie data file into a DataFrame using pandas.read_csv(). This will allow you to manipulate the data.
Inspect the dataset using .head() or .info() to understand its structure and check which columns are available.
Calculate the 3rd Quartile of Vote Count:

### You need to determine the third quartile (75th percentile) of the vote_count column. Use pandas' .quantile() method to do this.
Specifically, use df['vote_count'].quantile(0.75) to calculate the 75th percentile value for the vote_count column.
Filter Movies Based on Vote Count:

### Use the value obtained in step 3 to filter out movies whose vote_count is above the 3rd quartile.
Apply a filter to the DataFrame to select rows where the vote_count is greater than the value calculated. Use logical filtering (df[df['vote_count'] > third_quartile]) to do this.
Sort by Rating:

### After filtering, sort the filtered movies by the vote_average column in descending order. Use pandas' .sort_values() function for this purpose.
Sort the filtered DataFrame using the vote_average column to get the highest-rated movies. Make sure to set ascending=False so that it is sorted in descending order.
Return Top 10 Movies:

### Use the .head(10) function on the sorted DataFrame to get the top 10 highest-rated movies.
This will give you the final list of movies you need.
Output the Result:

Print or display the resulting list of movies.
You could use .to_string() to print the whole list neatly.

## 1. What does it mean that vote_count is above the 75th percentile?
When a value is above the 75th percentile, it means that it is greater than 75% of the other values in the dataset. In the context of your code, vote_count being above the 75th percentile means that you are selecting movies that have received a higher number of votes compared to most other moviesâ€”specifically, only the top 25% of movies based on vote count.

In statistical terms, the 75th percentile is also known as the third quartile (Q3). It essentially divides the data so that 75% of the observations are below it and 25% are above it.

## 2. What is the .quantile() method, what parameters does it take, and what similar methods do you know?
The .quantile() method is used to calculate quantiles (percentiles) for a numeric column in a DataFrame or Series. In your code, movies['vote_count'].quantile(0.75) calculates the value that marks the 75th percentile of the vote_count distribution.

### Parameters of .quantile():
- q: The quantile(s) to compute, which should be between 0 and 1. For example:
- 0.25 represents the first quartile (25th percentile).
- 0.50 represents the median (50th percentile).
- 0.75 represents the third quartile (75th percentile).
- You can also provide a list of quantiles to compute multiple values at once, like [0.25, 0.5, 0.75].

Similar Methods:
- .median(): Calculates the median of the column, which is equivalent to .quantile(0.5).
- .mean(): Calculates the mean (average) of the column.
- .describe(): Provides summary statistics of the DataFrame or Series, including percentiles (25%, 50%, and 75%).
## 3. How is head(10) different from [:10]?
Both head(10) and [:10] can be used to select the first 10 rows of a DataFrame, but there are some differences between them:

### head(10):
- This method is specifically designed for selecting the first few rows of a DataFrame or Series.
- It is more readable and makes it clear that you want the first 10 rows.
- It also works efficiently even if the number of rows in the DataFrame is less than 10.
### [:10]:
- This is standard Python slicing that can be applied to a DataFrame to get the first 10 rows.
- It works similarly to slicing a list or array.
- If the number of rows is less than 10, it will return all the available rows without any error.
- In general, head(10) is preferred for readability and clarity, especially when working with pandas DataFrames.
